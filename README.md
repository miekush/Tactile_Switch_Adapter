An adapter board for using standard 6MM PTH tactile switches with solderless breadboards

# Project Description
After getting frustrated with 6mm tactile switches constantly falling out of my breadboard prototypes, I decided to design this adapter PCB to allow for a more solid, pin header connection. There is also a footprint for an optional 0603 debouncing capacitor on the bottom side of the board.
